<p>Today, I‚Äôm super thrilled to tell you all about my latest tech escapade: packaging my very first Unreal Engine plugin, the <strong>SimpleCalendarPlugin</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="the-genesis-of-simplecalendarplugin">The Genesis of SimpleCalendarPlugin</h4>

<p>The idea began as a grand vision part of the <a href="https://www.thearcadianinitiative.com/">Arcadian Initiative</a>, but as with many initial plans, it underwent a transformation. I decided to focus on crafting a plugin with basic calendar functionality, a decision that taught me the valuable lesson of starting small and simple.</p>

<h4 id="overcoming-challenges">Overcoming Challenges</h4>

<p>The road to this achievement was not without its bumps. I encountered various issues, from debugging complex code segments to addressing unexpected performance bottlenecks. Each problem was a puzzle, demanding patience and creative problem-solving. I  must also admit, I had a lot of help from geniuses lurkng about in the discord tech groups.</p>

<h4 id="the-joy-of-learning">The Joy of Learning</h4>

<p>This experience has been incredibly rewarding, not just in terms of technical skills, but also in learning how to manage a project‚Äôs scope and the importance of testing and iteration. It‚Äôs a reminder that sometimes, stripping down an idea to its essentials can lead to a more robust and functional product.</p>

<h4 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h4>

<p>The Simple Calendar Plugin isn‚Äôt ready to hit the marketplace as of 11/13/2023 yet, but hey, we‚Äôre getting there! The journey ahead involves some testing, tweaking, and possibly reintegrating some of the initially planned features.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm dropping this story here to sprinkle some inspiration for anyone out there grinding on their code. Remember, every epic quest starts with step one, and every bug squashed is a mini victory. üèÜ</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, and stay tuned for more updates on the Simple Calendar Plugin!</p>
