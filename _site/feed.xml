<p>Hey there, Rails enthusiasts! Today, I want to document something I worked on a bit at office ‚Äì managing secrets in our Rails apps without pulling our hair out. üöÄ</p>

<h3 id="keeping-secrets-secret-in-rails">Keeping Secrets Secret in Rails</h3>

<h4 id="environment-variables">Environment Variables</h4>

<p>Where do we keep our secrets, aka, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret_key_base</code> and OAuth credentials? In environment variables, of course! Here‚Äôs the drill:</p>

<h4 id="setting-environment-variables--a-quick-how-to">Setting Environment Variables ‚Äì A Quick How-To</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>On VPS</strong>: Add them to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code> like so:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>export SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_super_secret_key
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cloud Providers &amp; Containers</strong>: They‚Äôve got their own fancy ways. Follow their docs, peace!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Heroku</strong>: Just a quick command away:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_super_secret_key
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rails-credentials-the-secret-keeper">Rails Credentials: The Secret Keeper</h3>

<p>You can edit Rails credentials using:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rails credentials:edit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>EDITOR="mate --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rails might ask you to add the ‚Äìwait option. Apparently it is important because it makes the command line process wait for the text editor to close the file, ensuring that your changes are saved correctly before the process continues</p>

<h3 id="common-sense-practices">Common Sense Practices</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Never</strong> hardcode secrets. Like, ever.</li>
  <li>Keep your circle of trust small ‚Äì limit who accesses your secrets.</li>
  <li>Change your secrets regularly. It‚Äôs like changing passwords but for your app.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="oauth-plugin-not-a-secret-agent">OAuth Plugin: Not a Secret Agent</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oauth-plugin</code> gem is cool for OAuth stuff but not for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret_key_base</code>. Remember to keep your OAuth keys in a safe spot too!</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Okay, I‚Äôll end it here. Like I said, not a master! But little nuggets of revelations here and there can make a difference.</p>

<p>Stay coding, my friends! Goodnight!</p>

<p>Today, I‚Äôm super thrilled to tell you all about my latest tech escapade: packaging my very first Unreal Engine plugin, the <strong>SimpleCalendarPlugin</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="the-genesis-of-simplecalendarplugin">The Genesis of SimpleCalendarPlugin</h4>

<p>The idea began as a grand vision part of the <a href="https://www.thearcadianinitiative.com/">Arcadian Initiative</a>, but as with many initial plans, it underwent a transformation. I decided to focus on crafting a plugin with basic calendar functionality, a decision that taught me the valuable lesson of starting small and simple.</p>

<h4 id="overcoming-challenges">Overcoming Challenges</h4>

<p>The road to this achievement was not without its bumps. I encountered various issues, from debugging complex code segments to addressing unexpected performance bottlenecks. Each problem was a puzzle, demanding patience and creative problem-solving. I  must also admit, I had a lot of help from geniuses lurkng about in the discord tech groups.</p>

<h4 id="the-joy-of-learning">The Joy of Learning</h4>

<p>This experience has been incredibly rewarding, not just in terms of technical skills, but also in learning how to manage a project‚Äôs scope and the importance of testing and iteration. It‚Äôs a reminder that sometimes, stripping down an idea to its essentials can lead to a more robust and functional product.</p>

<h4 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h4>

<p>The Simple Calendar Plugin isn‚Äôt ready to hit the marketplace as of 11/13/2023 yet, but hey, we‚Äôre getting there! The journey ahead involves some testing, tweaking, and possibly reintegrating some of the initially planned features.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm dropping this story here to sprinkle some inspiration for anyone out there grinding on their code. Remember, every epic quest starts with step one, and every bug squashed is a mini victory. üèÜ</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, and stay tuned for more updates on the Simple Calendar Plugin!</p>
