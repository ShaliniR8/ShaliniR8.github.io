# Welcome to my Blog!

Hello! I'm Shalini, a software engineer and machine learning enthusiast. This blog is where I share my journey through the tech world, from coding adventures to AI explorations. Expect this place to look like a 10 year old's playground, because I'm just getting started.

## About the Blog

This blog is built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is a place where I document my progress, challenges, and insights as I dive into various projects. Expect to see:

- 🧠 My journey through personal projects
- 💻 Tutorials and code snippets
- 🛠️ DIY project showcases
- 🎨 Creative experiments with technology

## In Progress: Atm0s Calendar
